R code needed to run a simulation study  using block-Nearest Neighbor Gaussian process (block-NNGP)  and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) using INLA as proposed in 
"Fast Bayesian inference of Block Nearest Neighbor Gaussian models for large data" by Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates, Dipak Dey and HÃ¥vard Rue (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06437.pdf).
